Software Issue Manager allows to track the progress and resolution of every project issue in a productive and efficient way.

== Description ==
Software Issue Manager community edition helps organize content on projects and issues. Issues are the things you would like to track in your projects. Issues could be tasks, feature requests, bugs or pretty much any thing you need related to your projects.
 
Projects are temporary organizations formed up to produce a final deliverable for project clients. Projects are identified by a name and a version number. Issues can be shared by multiple projects. Community version supports "open" projects which do not require participants to login to WordPress. Premium versions limit access to content by user's role and are appropriate for "closed" projects which require users to login to access content.

= Community edition =
Software Issue Manager community edition is for developers who work on projects which are open to public. There is no content access limitation. Built-in WordPress roles (based on post access) are used to limit user access capabilities. It allows users create, search, and track issues from the front-end and backend.

One can set issue priority, status, category, and assign tags to better organize issue content. Optionally, browsers and operating system taxonomies are provided as well. The app allows to relate one issue to many projects. For example; issue A could be related to Project B, C, D  which are identified by a name and a version number. You can upload and display links to the issue documents from/on the front-end and admin area.

Issue participants can comment using the WP built-in commenting system. A sidebar widget is also provided to display recent issues. If you are using a well-written, nonintrusive theme, there should not be a need to modify theme files since the app does only change the content area of the frontend and tries to mind its own business in terms of css specificity.

We hope it would be helpful for most developers and designers. For development teams with strict content access requirements, we recommend premium versions.
