Software Issue Manager allows to track the progress and resolution of every project issue in a productive and efficient way.

== Description ==
Software Issue Manager is bug, issue, task and product feature request tracking system with extensive built-in and custom reporting capabilities. Premium editions are available. 

Issues are the things you would like to track in your projects. Issues could be tasks, feature requests, bugs or pretty much any thing you need related to your projects.

Projects are temporary organizations formed up to produce a final deliverable for project clients. Projects are identified by a name and a version number. Issues can be shared by multiple projects. Community version supports "open" projects which do not require participants to login to WordPress. Premium versions limit access to content by user's role and are appropriate for "closed" projects which require users to login to access content.

* Allows upload and display links to the issue documents from/on the front-end and admin area.
